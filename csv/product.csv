My clothes fit better and look much neater. One thing the sales lady encouraged me to do, and I am so thankful that I did, was go to a larger cup size. I had always been told I was a B cup. She told me to trust her and go to a D. After laughing for a very long time I agreed to try it. And WOW is all I can say. I am not a large woman at all but as we age we get a little extra padding in certain places. Going to the larger cup size allowed me to tuck that padding in and really looks nice.

The Full/Queen quilt is really too small. Please note that the bedspreads are the correct sizes--go with those instead of the quilts (plus they have a true queen size, not a full/queen). Had I picked up on the actual measurements, I would have ordered the bedspreads instead.

I liked the stripes and they do look very nice with my slate blue room and dark wood furniture. However, as other customers have indicated, they are very, very thin even though they are lined - the lining is also thin. I also bought 2 of the valences since the drapes hang on either side of a wide window. The valences are of a good weight. However, both the drapery panels and the valences were very uneven in length. I had to shorten the drapes anyway and add a thermal lining (I made it), so I made the drape panels even when shortened them and then I sewed the lining to the top of the back side of the panels. Because the valences were also very uneven, I had to take them apart and make them more even before I could join them together to make a very wide valance. I had planned to just join the 2 valences by lightly stitching them together. :-( Getting the panels and valence ready to hang turn-out to be a rather large project!!

She told me it was her new favorite bra and she got rid of all her other bras because once she wore this bra she was not comfortable in another bra.

So I will be ordering multiple of these whenever i get any chance to. The difference between my purple 09402 and the other 05881 is the back strap style.

The lining is thin -- just enough to give the cup shape, no faking an extra cup size or two or shoving your girls up to your neck, and it barely shows a line under clothes. I throw them in the washing machine and hang to dry, and I haven't had an underwire snap or poke out under the arm yet.

I expected this one to be similar to the others. However, I was not very impressed with the quality of the product. The sides that go around the mattress are so long that you have to tuck them under the mattress which makes it difficult to get a sheet on. I understand that they try to accomodate all mattresses, but I don't know of any mattress that is that deep, it's ridiculous. It also has a plastic piece that connects to the plug that is on the top of the mattress pad on each side of the king size dual pad, so it is hard to avoid scratching your foot on it. I have never had a pad where that was on the top, it was always underneath the pad so it was smooth on the top. It has the same heating functions as all others and is uniform in warmth but the poor quality really takes away from my overall view of this product.""}, {""review_2""=>""I have purchased several of these warmers over the years but know something's been changed. This company HAD the hottest warmers but this one barely gets warm and the auto-off feature was not on the others I want to stay warm all night not wake up cold they need to take that feature off. It seems now the quality of products are not there but the price keeps going up. Though the price of this one is excellent it's not worth the money. My house is old and cold so I need this. If you've purchased these in the past let me tell you the quality is GONE, GONE, GONE.""}, {""review_3""=>""I have owned this item for three years now, and had to replace the whole thing after the first year as one of the controls went bad and kept \""E\"" error on the control panel (king size 2 control unit).

I wish you could purchase a simple item like this and have it work as it should, Give me a good old vintage heated blanket with out electronic controls, they work the best.""}, {""review_4""=>""Love this heated mattress pad! Ordered the queen size - it had dual controls which is a have to in my house! Love the zonal heating as my feet are always cold. The heated mattress pad actually relaxes my body and I'm not near as stiff in the mornings as I used to be. Also suffer from nightly repeated leg cramps and this pad has actually helped relax those a great deal, woohoo!

This heated mattress pad is a game changer for him. Used with an electric blanket, this really helps him out. Only drawback is the additional heating wires at the feet: at first it feels really good, but then gets too hot. If there were a way to control that section independently, I would give the product an excellent overall rating. Otherwise, it performs just as expected/needed.""}, {""review_6""=>""The only flaws to this product is that the Full Sized model has only one temperature control with two people in the bed who have different preferences. Also the raised plug is then on the bottom right corner of the bed and so during the night I scrape my foot over the connection. It would be nice if it was just over the edge of the mattress vs. on top. Love the warmth however and it heats up quickly.""}, {""review_7""=>""I have this on all my beds. We enjoy the features that this mattress pad has. It has dual controls that plug in at the head of the bed. The plug in is smooth, flat and under the pillow area. It has a Nylon type skirt that is loose. Once you put your sheets on it is no longer a problem. It has reinforced openings in the mattress skirt for the plugs to slip in. It is a little tight but this helps to keep the plugs from slipping out when you install it. The dual controls have a digital display and an easy on & off button. You can feel the size difference between the up / down and on/ off. If you want to turn it on in the middle of the night you don't have to turn on a light, just reach over and feel for the right button. We have had these pads for more than 5 years and the warranty is wonderful. We have only had to have 1 replaced due to a malfunction in a controller. They sent us a new mattress pad and controllers. This too was a blessing. Now we have an extra pad to put down when we are doing laundry. This pad washes and dries wonderfully. It is not too thick and does not become \""lumpy\"" like my quilted mattress pads. It is thin enough to leave on the bed all year round under our mattress protecting pad. I never have to worry about it burning me like a regular heating pad.It does not have a pre heat, but you can easily turn it on before you go to bed an it is ready when you are. It has a 1 to 9 temp. selector. I leave mine at 4. My husband likes 7 and it turns itself off in 10 hours. We don't have to fight for the covers because we are both just warm enough. Our cat has even learned to turn it on when she wants to snuggle in on cold winter days.""}, {""review_8""=>""I had originally purchased another brand. One I had problems with around 10 years ago...thinking they improved since that time and was disappointed to find out they hadn't. So I called JCP and found what I replaced the old ones with and placed my order! These work great and there is no interruption during the night to reset the controls.""}]}"

Clean up is a snap because everything fits in the dishwasher. If there is anything to complain about is the finish. I chose the black front and from a across the kitchen it looks fine but up close the finish has blotches in it, like water marks on a auto paint job.

I love all the settings to chose from for auto times and then the choice for how toasted/baked I desire is very nice. I have been nothing but smiling since this arrived and we set it up in the kitchen. Yes it takes up space because it is a nice size but it is so worth it!

I've made toast and baked casseroles in it and everything turned out perfect. I love the \""frozen\"" button. It takes all the guesswork out of toasting frozen bread.

So far, I've cooked Cornish game hens, pork roasts, pork chops, onion rings, breaded mushrooms, seafood, pizzas, brownies, and blueberry bread, all with excellent results. My only gripe ( and it is a minor one) is that the time/temperature dial sometimes feels a bit spongy and the feedback is less than reassuring for such a well regarded appliance manufacturer. I suspect this is not the norm for this particular appliance and that my experience is uncommon. Overall, I'm very pleased with this little oven and would recommend it without hesitation.""}]}"

The chair has a texture to it that can't be seen in close up images or in the color slides.
